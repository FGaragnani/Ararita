The things that could be potentially improved are:
* **Balance**: this game may be unbalanced. In the long run, some enemies may be too easy to defeat and the reward-difficulty ratio may scale differently. Some game-breaking classes or spells may also be found and exploited. Furthermore, enhancements to the stats increase, EXP and damage calculator are probably needed. So these balance issues - easy to spot after playing a while - may very well be addressed.
* **New content**: may it be new enemies, new backgrounds, new music, new character sprites or any other thing really is very well accepted! Please, comply with the style of the game; assets - both graphic and musical - should be blended among the ones already present. If the added assets need credit, give it.
 * **Sound effects**: even if the option is there, you may have noticed that - as of now - the game has no sound effect at all!
* **Graphical enhancements**: mainly regarding portability issues.
